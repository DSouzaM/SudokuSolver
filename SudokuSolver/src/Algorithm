9x9 byte array for grid, 9x9 byte array to keep track of how many values are possible in a cell

At the start of the program, each array will simply have zeroes.
Every time a number is added, the 9x9 "possible" array is updated via function call
The function first adds any values where only 1 possible value is possible
Then the function finds a cell with the least number of possible values, and recursively calls itself on duplicate grids with these potential values entered
The branching will continue until a grid is either full (solved) or has empty cells with no possible values (contradiction, returns an invalid solution to step back in the recursion)
